You can also use R and RStudio that you have installed locally.

## Install R 4+

Any version of R 4+ will be fine. 

https://cran.r-project.org/

## Install RStudio Desktop

Please update to the latest version of RStudio Desktop: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. Quarto comes bundled with RStudio so you do not need to install it separately.

## Install the needed packages

We will update this section closer to the workshops.
