title: Git - Jupyter Lab
---

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will provide a brief introduction to:

1.  Command line (**terminal**/shell)
2.  Navigating around folders in Jupyter Lab
3.  Version Control (code management using **git**)
4.  Setting up Git in Jupyter Lab
5.  The Git GUI in Jupyter Lab
6.  Basic Git commands

## Introduction :: Jupyter Lab

When you start the JupyterHub, you will be in Jupyter Lab. From there you can click on the RStudio box and open RStudio. However for this tutorial, we will stay in Juptyer Lab.

## Introduction :: Terminal/Shell

Log into the JupyterHub. If you do not see this

![](img/jhub-launcher.png)

Then go to File \> New Launcher

Click on the "Terminal" box to open a new terminal window.

### Shell or Terminal Basics

1.  [What is Terminal or Shell?](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro/index.html)
2.  [Navigating Files and Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html)
3.  [Working with Files and Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html)
4.  Optional: Detailed self-paced lesson on running scripts from the shell: [Shell Lesson from Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

You will need only basic navigation skills for this course: `cd`, `ls` and `cat`

-   `pwd` where am I
-   `cd nameofdir` move into a directory
-   `cd ..` move up a directory
-   `ls` list the files in the current directory
-   `ls -a` list the files including hidden files
-   `ls -l` list the files with more info
-   `cat filename` print out the contents of a file

### Let's try

```         
ls
ls -a
cd shared
ls
cd shell-tutorial
cat lesson1.sh
cd ..
cd ..
```

### Close the terminal

Just click on the X in the terminal tab

## Introduction :: File Navigation

In the far left, you will see a line of icons. The top one is a folder and allows us to move around our file system.

1.  Click on `shared`. Now you can see the files in the shared directory.

2.  Click on `shell-tutorial`. Then click on `lesson1.sh`. The file opens. You won't be able to save changes here because you don't have write permission on this drive.

3.  Click on the folder icon that looks like this. Click on the actual folder image. ![](img/folder-icon.png)

    Now it should look like this folder / 
    
    This shows me doing this
    
    ![](img/folder-select.gif)
    
4. Create a new folder. 

    * Next to the blue rectange with a +, is a grey folder with a +. Click that to create a new folder, called `lesson-scripts`.
    * Then click on `lesson-scripts` to enter the folder
    
    ![](img/folder-create-folder.gif)
    
5. Create a new file

    * Create with File > New > Text file
    * The file will open and you can edit it.
    * Save with File > Save Text
    * Delete the file by right-clicking on it and clicking "Delete"

## Introduction :: Version Control (Git)

### What is version control, git, github, and how to set it up?

Version control is managing and tracking changes to your documents (program source code, images, websites, data files, etc.). `git` is a popular tool used for version control of software code. [github.com](https://github.com/) is popular platform that provides remote server hosting for git repositories. A repository is a collection of various files that you are tracking for changes and versions. Currently GitHub is the most popular platform for file sharing code and code packages.

This section is a step-by-step guide to set up `git` on our [JupyterHub](https://nmfs-openscapes.2i2c.cloud/). We will also configure `git` to use your [github.com](https://github.com/) account for managing your repositories hosted on [github.com](https://github.com/). There are 5 main steps.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub account

To complete the setup, you will need an account on [github.com](https://github.com/). If you don't have an account, please visit [github.com](https://github.com/), create an account (free) and come back to this guide for setting up git.

### Step 2: Clone a repository

We have created a demo repository for you to clone:

https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/Git-Lesson

1.  Start your [JupyterHub](https://nmfs-openscapes.2i2c.cloud/)

2.  Click on the Git icon

![](img/gitextension.png)

3.  Click "Clone a Repository"

4.  Where it says "Enter the URI of the remote Git repository", paste in the URL https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/EDMW-EarthData-Workshop-2024

5. The folder appears and you can enter the folder and edit and create files.

> Your task: Create a file with your name and save to the Git-Lesson folder

## Step 3: 

Configure git with your name and email address.

````         
``` bash
git config --global user.name "Makhan Virdi"
git config --global user.email "Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com"
```

**Note:** This name and email could be different from your github.com credentials. Remember `git` is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on the JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by `git`, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you `push` your repository to github.com (`git push` is discussed in a later step).
````

4.  Configure `git` to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in [Step 5](#step-5.-create-access-token-on-github.com), we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)

    ``` bash
    git config --global credential.helper store
    ```

5.  Copy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green "Code" button and copy the link as shown.

    ![](img/github-clone.png)

6.  Clone the repository using `git clone` command in the terminal

    To clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use `git clone`:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup
    ```

    **Note:** Replace `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` here with your github.com username. For example, it is `virdi` for my github.com account as seen in this image.

    ![](img/terminal-clone.png){width="520"}

    Use `ls` (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned

    ![](img/terminal-clone-confirm-ls.png){width="520"}

7.  Change directory to the cloned repository using `cd check_github_setup` and check the current directory using `pwd` command (present working directory)

    ![](img/terminal-cd-repo.png){width="520"}

8.  Check status of your git repository to confirm git set up using `git status`

    ![](img/terminal-git-status.png)

    You are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.

    In the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.

### Step 4. Creating new file and tracking changes

1.  In the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the "directory" icon and then double click on "check_github_setup" directory.

    ![](img/notebook-cd.png)

    ![](img/notebook-cd-result.png)

2.  Once you are in the **check_github_setup** directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (`File >> New >> Text File`).

    ![](img/%20notebook-new-file.png)

    Name the file lastname.txt. For example, **virdi.txt** for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my **virdi.txt** file: `my last name is virdi`).

    ![](img/notebook-rename-file.png)

3.  Now you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory **check_github_setup**

4.  Check if `git` can see that you have added a new file using `git status`. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.

    ![](img/git-status.png)

5.  As seen in this image, `git` suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to `git` for tracking changes using `git add`. Then, you can commit changes to this file's content using `git commit` as shown in the image.

    ``` bash
    git add virdi.txt
    git status
    git commit -m "adding a new file"
    git status
    ```

    ![](img/git-add-commit.png)

6.  As seen in the image above, `git` is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).

    **Note: DO NOT** execute `push` yet. Before we push to github.com, let's configure `git` further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke `git push`. For doing so, we need to create a **token** on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.

### Step 5. Create access token on github.com {#step-5.-create-access-token-on-github.com}

1.  Go to your github account and create a new "personal access token": <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new>

    [![Generate Personal Access Token on github.com](img/github-token.png)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)

2.  Enter a description in "Note" field as seen above, select "repo" checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button "Generate Token". Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).

    **IMPORTANT:** You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.

    ![](img/github-token-generated.png)

3.  To push (transfer) your changes to github, use `git push` in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and "password". **When prompted for your "password", DO NOT use your github password, use the github token** that was copied in the previous step.

    ``` bash
    git push
    ```

    ![](img/terminal-github-credentials.png)

    **Note:** When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer's keyboard shortcut for paste.

4.  Now your password is stored in `~/.git-credentials` and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal. Here the `~` character represents your home directory (`/home/jovyan/`).

    ``` bash
    ls -la ~
    ```

    The output looks like this:

    ``` bash
    drwxr-xr-x 13 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 22 17:35 .
    drwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   4096 Oct  4 16:21 ..
    -rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan 1754 Oct 29 18:30 .bash_history
    drwxr-xr-x  4 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 29 16:38 .config
    -rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan   66 Oct 22 17:35 .git-credentials
    -rw-r--r--  1 jovyan jovyan   84 Oct 22 17:14 .gitconfig
    drwxr-xr-x 10 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 21 16:19 2021-Cloud-Hackathon
    ```

    You can also verify your git configuration

    ``` bash
    (notebook) jovyan@jupyter-virdi:~$ git config -l
    ```

    The output should have `credential.helper = store`:

    ``` bash
    user.email        = Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com
    user.name         = Makhan Virdi
    credential.helper = store
    ```

Now we are all set to collaborate with github on the JupyterHub during the Cloud Hackathon!

### Cloning our repository using the [**git Jupyter lab extension**](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git).

If we're already familiar with git commands and feel more confortable using a GUI our Jupyterhub deployment comes with a git extension. This plugin allows us to operate with git using a simple user interface.

For example we can clone our repository using the extension.
