## Access to the JupyterHub

### GitHub username

* Create a GitHub account (if you donâ€™t already have one) at <https://github.com>. Advice for choosing a GitHub username: this is a professional username that you will use in work settings. GitHub accounts are not anonymous; this is for sharing work. Using your real name is common.
* Write down your username and password; you will need to log in during the course!
* Here is [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHXw4mGoqiE) showing the whole process

### Get on JupyterHub

Once you have submitted your GitHub username and have been accepted as a member on the nmfs-openscapes organization, you can log-into the JupyterHub.
