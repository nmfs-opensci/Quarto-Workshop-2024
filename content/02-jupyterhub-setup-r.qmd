title: R/RStudio on JupyterHub
---

You can use RStudio on your computer or on the NMFS Openscapes JupyterHub. The environment will be identical. On the JupyterHub, everything you need is already installed for you. 

Note, before you can log in to the JupyterHub, we will need to add you to the access group. If you are in the NMFS Openscapes Champions or Mentors cohort, then you already have access if you are in the GitHub teams: [champions](https://github.com/orgs/nmfs-openscapes/teams/2024-nmfs-champions-cohort) or [mentors](https://github.com/orgs/nmfs-openscapes/teams/2024-mentors). If you are in the fall cohorts, but see a 404 when you click on the teams link, then we need to add you to one of those teams. If you are participating in the workshop but not the Openscapes program, you are also welcome to use the JupyterHub for this training opportunity. 

[**Fill out this Google Form if you need JupyterHub access**](https://forms.gle/JydKyooTSSMTLkwe8). It will ask for your GitHub username

-   <https://nmfs-openscapes.2i2c.cloud>
-   Click Start Server and accept defaults
-   Click the RStudio button. If you don't see it, click the blue button in the top left to open a new 'Launcher' window.

## Access to the JupyterHub

### GitHub username


* Log into GitHub.com. Authentication to the JupyterHub uses your username and being a member of the  NMFS Openscapes GitHub org.

### Get on JupyterHub

Once you have submitted your GitHub username and have been accepted as a member on the nmfs-openscapes organization, you can log-into the JupyterHub. For those who did the GitHub clinic, you should be good to go.

* home directory is yours and no one else can see it.
* To share files, you can connect to a GitHub repository or use the `shared` directory. Everyone can read and write to this directory. Please don't delete content that is not your own.

This is a platform for training. Please do not put confidential info on here.
