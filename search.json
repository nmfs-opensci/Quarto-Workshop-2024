While we will be walking everyone through the tutorials, it may be helpful for you to look through the tutorials prior to attending. This will give you a feel for what we will be covering during each session, and will highlight some areas where you may need some additional work or assistance.\nFor this session, we will be covering the following topics:\n\nhttps://carpentries-incubator.github.io/reproducible-publications-quarto/02-quarto/05-code-qmd/index.html\nhttps://carpentries-incubator.github.io/reproducible-publications-quarto/02-quarto/06-rendering-code-yaml/index.html\n\nFor this week’s tutorials, we will be relying on the forked repository from the previous week. If you have not yet set up your forked repository in RStudio, follow the instructions here: https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/Quarto-Workshop-2024/tutorials/tutorial-2.html#instructions-for-forking-the-carpentries-example-repository",

A repository is a collection of various files that you are tracking for changes and versions. Currently GitHub is the most popular platform for file sharing code and code packages.\nThis section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on our JupyterHub. We will also configure git to use your github.com account for managing your repositories hosted on github.com. There are 5 main steps.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a GitHub account\nTo complete the setup, you will need an account on github.com. If you don’t have an account, please visit github.com, create an account (free) and come back to this guide for setting up git.\n\n\nStep 2: Clone a repository\nWe have created a demo repository for you to clone:\nhttps://github.com/nmfs-opensci/Git-Lesson\n\nStart your JupyterHub\nClick on the Git icon\n\n\n\nClick “Clone a Repository”\nWhere it says “Enter the URI of the remote Git repository”, paste in the URL https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/EDMW-EarthData-Workshop-2024\nThe folder appears and you can enter the folder and edit and create files.\n\n\nYour task: Create a file with your name and save to the Git-Lesson folder"

Remember `git` is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on the JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by `git`, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you `push` your repository to github.com (`git push` is discussed in a later step).\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\n\n\nGenerate Personal Access Token on github.com\n\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token.

This will put a copy of the repository in your GitHub that will allow you to make commits without changing the original repository. To make things go smoothly in future sessions, make sure you set up your forked repository in RStudio. Instructions below and here a video showing Eli forking the repository.\n\nTo fork the repository, go to the following link: https://github.com/UCSBCarpentry/Quarto-Project-Example/fork\nThis should take you to a screen that looks something like the attached screenshot. Keep everything the way it is and click the “Create Fork” button in the bottom right-hand corner of the page. Once the repository finishes setting up, it will open with the forked copy on your GitHub.\n\nAfter forking the repository, click the green Code button in the center-right of the repository window. This will bring down a dropdown menu with the link to the forked repository. Copy the link using the icon with the two squares on the right.\n\nIn RStudio (either in JupyterHub or desktop), go to the File menu and click New Project. In the dialogue box that pops up, click Version Control, then Git. Paste your copied repository URL from GitHub into the URL box (the Project directory name will auto-populate). RStudio will create a folder as a subdirectory that includes all of the files from the forked repository. If you are working on your own desktop version of RStudio, you may want to change the project directory; otherwise, leave this as a default.

    "section": "Zotero and Quarto: a Powerful Pairing",
    "text": "Zotero and Quarto: a Powerful Pairing\nZotero is a free, open-source reference manager that integrates directly into RStudio and Quarto. Reference managers make life easier by providing a central location to store, access, and organize your reference collection. Zotero takes this to the next level by allowing you to directly add references from your library into your Quarto document. Zotero stores its references in a flat text-based BibTex file, rather than a proprietary file format only readable by a single application. This makes sharing reference libraries across teams much easier and more open than with other, paid reference management software.\n\nImport into Zotero from EndNote or Mendeley\nIf you currently use a different reference manager, you can import your library into Zotero. The steps are a bit different depending which reference manager you currently use:\n\nTo import from EndNote, you will first need to export your EndNote references as an XML file, which you can then import into Zotero. This link provides instructions for doing this: https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/endnote_import\nUnfortunately, if you rely on EndNote Groups for organizing your references, this method will not preserve group structure. Zotero does have its own organizing feature, called Collections. If you wish to retain the group structure from EndNote as a set of Zotero Collections, you will either need to export groups into individual XML files and import groups individually, or export your full library as one file and re-organize your references into collections after import.\nImporting from Mendeley is a bit easier. Zotero can connect directly to a Mendeley online library: https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/mendeley_import\n\n\n\nConnect Zotero and RStudio\nOnce your Zotero library is set up, you will need to connect it to RStudio. If you’re using RStudio and Zotero on your local machine, navigate to RStudio, click on the Tools menu in the top menu bar, and click on Global Options. In the dialogue box that pops up, click on R Markdown on the left side, and then Citations in the top menu:\n\nSelect the Local option in the Zotero Library dropdown menu. Click the Browse button and navigate to the folder where your Zotero library data is stored. If you have multiple Zotero libraries, select the one you would like to use. Check the box for Use Better BibTeX for citation keys and BibTeX export; this option gives you many more fields and reference types to choose from when adding references.\nYou can also connect Zotero if you are using RStudio on a machine that does not have access to a local Zotero installation or in the cloud (our JupyterHub, for example). Zotero provides a web-based service that will synchronize your library between your local installation and an online account. You will need to create a Zotero account, which you will then need to link with a local Zotero install to synchronize your library (Edit -&gt; Settings -&gt; Sync).\nOnce your Zotero library is synced to Zotero Web, create a Zotero API key to access your library from RStudio. Give your key a name (like RStudio or JupyterHub), and give the key Read Only access to your personal library and groups:\n\nClick Save Key, then copy the resulting string to your clipboard. Back in your RStudio Citations options, select the Web dropdown item next to Zotero Library, and paste your Web API Key copied from Zotero into the appropriate space:\n\nYou can verify that the key was created and copied over correctly by clicking the Verify Key button. Once you’ve verified that the key works, click OK, exit out RStudio, and re-open. If using JupyterHub, you may need to restart your JupyterHub instance. Next time you open a Quarto document in RStudio, you will be able to insert a citation directly from your Zotero library using the @ symbol."
